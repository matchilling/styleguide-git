# Git Styleguide

## Git Commit Messages

The seven rules of a great git commit message:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line and do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
